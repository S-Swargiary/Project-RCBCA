# Project-RCBCA
This repo is to develop a **website** for our department

************IMPORTANT RULES YOU SHOULD FOLLOW************

1. Always *create a new branch* when you are making changes to the files. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, 'dev-section-frontend' or 'file-tranfer-backend' etc. Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake. Your changes will not end up on the default branch until we merge your branch.

2. Commit each changed file *separately* so that  you can add a *comments* to explain what is changed and why then craete a pull request to the default branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and other contributors understand what changes the commit contains. For example, "Changed margin from 10px to 20px" or "Modified Javascrip file of HOD dashboard page to change teacher edit option as dynamic" etc.

3. Always create a **pull request** to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. You can also manually @mention or request a review from specific people or teams.

4. After your pull request get merged, **delete your branch**. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.
