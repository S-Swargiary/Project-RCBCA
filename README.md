This repo is to develop a **website** for our department

************IMPORTANT RULES YOU SHOULD FOLLOW**************

1. Always *create a new branch* when you are making changes to the files. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, 'dev-section-frontend' or 'file-tranfer-backend' etc. Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake. Your changes will not end up on the default branch until you merge your branch.

2. Commit each file changes *differently* so that  you can add a *comments* to tell what is the change that you made then push your changes to your branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and other contributors understand what changes the commit contains. For example, "Created a new HTML file for HOD home page" or "Modified Javascrip file of HOD dashboard page to change teacher edit option as dynamic" etc.

3. Always create a **pull request** to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. You can also manually @mention or request a review from specific people or teams.

4. After your pull request get merged, **delete your branch**. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.
